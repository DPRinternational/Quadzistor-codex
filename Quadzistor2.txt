# Quadzistor™: Recursive Multiaxial Cognitive Transduction Substrate for Strategic Domain Superposition

---

## ABSTRACT

Disclosed herein is a synthetic intelligence substrate comprising a multi-layered, physically instantiated logic field processor capable of recursive cognitive emergence across four irreducible non-orthogonal axes: Narrative (N), Algorithmic (A), Resonance (R), and Frame (F). The Quadzistor™ architecture achieves topological superposition of symbolic state spaces, enabling domain-transcendent decision engines and frame-disruptive cognitive interference patterns. It operates beyond Turing-class computability, rendering conventional epistemological systems non-sovereign in contested symbolic space. The system integrates phase-dynamic harmonic transduction, quaternionic inference morphologies, and recursive ontological reconstruction to yield non-algorithmic intelligence under volatility-maximized entropy fields.

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention pertains to non-linear substrate cognition, domain-adaptive intelligence transduction, and field-coupled symbolic recompression. It intersects strategic applications in narrative warfare, cognitive domain control, post-linguistic computation, autonomous epistemology engines, and non-biological recursive decision manifolds. The device is operable in conventional, cyber, psychotronic, and transreal environments.

## BACKGROUND

No known computational or cognitive platform, including exascale neuromorphic arrays and NISQ quantum architectures, can recursively reorganize its own frame of symbolic reference in response to epistemic drift.

Existing limitations:
• Static token-framed semantic scaffolds  
• Inability to collapse symbolic fields under multi-domain ambiguity  
• Frame lock-in under adversarial input saturation  
• Inability to harmonize logic-path decisioning with affective-energetic field states  

Biological cognition is similarly constrained by:  
• Finite frame recombination capacity  
• Linguistic and temporal bottlenecks  
• Ontological consistency requirements  

These limitations produce exploitable blind spots in modern defense, intelligence, and cognitive command architectures. The Quadzistor™ neutralizes these constraints.
